# Basic computer algebra system
Functionality includes:
   - Matrix arithemtic
   - Vector arithmetic
   - Rational numbers arithmetic
   - Rational Expressions arithmetic
   - Polynomial arithmetic

It is obviously a toy but thats how you learn :-)

# Usage
```
* g++ matrix.cpp
* ./a.out
```

* Tests
```
* g++ -std=c++14 vector_tests.cpp
* ./a.out
```
